The premise of this project is to create an algorithmic trading platform/strategy.

As is commonly known, also stocks, no matter how safe, possess some quantity of volatility.
However, no matter how volatile, the range is typically fairly contained, unless there is an 
event induced change such as earning or breaking news. Furtheremore, the few stocks that are 
outliers to this rule are typically less liquid making trading more difficult, risky, and hard
to predict.

In an attempt to find profits, I believe options are a great place to start for high yield.
Without a doubt, options have some of the most volatility of all financial instruments traded
on public markets due to their leveraged nature. Furtheremore, due to its fairly strict relation-
ship with the undrlying security, options present an unique asymmetric opportunity. 

The opportunity lies in the nature of the underlying equity security. Almost always, equities
have some form of momentum driving their position either upwards or downwards. Whether this
be due to event driven activity, or simply broad market movement, there is almost always 
momentum of some form. However, because equities are only capable of moving so much in one day,
it is difficult to capture these bursts of momentum because by the time it is even registered
as significant, the window of profit is gone. Additionally, equities have many many competitors
in the market making the competitive edge almost impossible to find without massive amounts of
infrastructure resources.

Which brings me to options. Options are a less liquid market which increases the risk several
fold. Combined with leverage, the risk profile is often considered ludicrous. However, there 
are several key steps that can reduce the risk thus making the expected return asymmetric.

The key to making options a viable security to trade is understanding what changes the price.
The major components to options prices are the underlying security itself, time decay, and 
implied volatility. Accounting for three separate variables and correctly assessing them to
understand option pricing in real time is a task beyond the scope of my abilities and the scope
of this endeavor at this moment.

So how does a newly minted college freshman tackle this challenge, simple, by eliminating as many 
variables as possible in order to create an environment in which the problem can be manageable 
and actually tackled.

And this is achieved by trading on an extremely short time interval, in the hours if not minutes,
combined with tackling options markets with as much liquidity as possible. In my case, I will 
be tackling the options chains on SPY ETF that are close to expiry due to their extreme sensitivity
to the underlying movement combined with their high volume and low spreads.

Hopefully this is the beginning of what is a fruitful endeavor.
