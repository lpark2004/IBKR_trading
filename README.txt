The premise of this project is to create an algorithmic trading platform/strategy.

Our underlying belief is that volatility in public equities on an extremely short term basis
can be predicted based on momentum and a variety of related factors.
It is clear that long term prediction in the stock market is nearly impossible due to the 
nature of complex systems interacting with each other combined with random events such as
wars and natural disasters. 
As such we aim to eliminate conflicting variables by limiting ourselves to a short time frame
measured in minutes, and at times even by seconds.
We are also fully aware that competing with market makers and HFT is pointless due to our lack 
of infrastructure.
As such here is the beginning of what is hopefully a fruitful journey.
